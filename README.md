<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project was to use some of the key ASP.NET skills that I had, to create a project. The website is designed to take a book ISBN and add it to your personal page which you can edit. You are able to view another persons portfolio, if its public, by going to example.com/[Username].

The focus for this project was on the backend, rather then front end design.

This project is currently designed to be runnable within Visual Studios, however you are able to run it using "dotnet run".
Once this project is in a better foundation, there will be more in-depth instruction for usage for running this project for personal use.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

### 0.1

-   [x] Add a button to add a book from another person's portfolio to "Want to reads"

### 0.2

-   [x] Query a book title to then select which to add to your portfolio.
-   [ ] Implement CI/CD to strengthen this skill.

### 0.3

-   [ ] Improve editing feature set.
-   [ ] The ability to select which cover or any details for a book when you insert into your portfolio.
-   [ ] More details about the book on the pages.

### STRETCH GOAL - Goals that are out of scope for the moment, but desire to do.

-   [ ] Move from Razor pages to using React.
-   [ ] AI recommender system - AI is prepared and can be trained, however test datasets are outdated, plus needs data on website (Might just create some "temp" data to demonstrate this feature).
